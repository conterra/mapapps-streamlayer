# Streamlayer Bundle
The streamlayer bundle makes ArcGIS Service of type "STREAM_LAYER" usable in map.apps. After activating the bundle inside your app you can configure the service inside your map model as operational layer of type "STREAM_LAYER". For more details please review the sample app configuration.

A stream layer uses HTML5 websockets to connect to a webserver that emits geographic features continuously. For more information about esri streamlayer read here: https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/streamlayer-amd.html

This bundle requires your browser to support HTML5 web sockets. Therefore you should use at least Internet Explorer 10, Chrome 27, Firefox 27, Safari 7.1 or later.
